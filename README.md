Hello, my name is Claudio and i am sending this pm to apply for gm, so this is my application.
i've been playing Toribash for 1 year with this account(iRaven19), but i met the game in 2009, unfortunately, I stopped playing before meeting forums.
lately i've been helping people on #support, i'm there 24/7 and i try to help when i can.
